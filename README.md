How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding user needs starts with clear communication and feedback from stakeholders. Creating user stories helps translate user needs into actionable tasks by breaking down requirements into specific, measurable goals. For example, during the SNHU Travel project, user stories like “As a traveler, I want to filter destinations by budget so that I can find affordable options” provided clear direction for the development team. This approach ensures the program aligns with user expectations while being manageable for the team to implement.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development with a focus on iteration and collaboration. Agile processes like daily standups, sprint reviews, and backlog refinement help keep work organized and responsive to changing requirements. In the future, I plan to incorporate user stories, iterative development, and frequent testing to ensure high-quality deliverables that meet user needs. The flexibility of Agile allows for continuous improvement, which is key to successful development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means contributing to the team’s goals while fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. This includes clear communication, willingness to adapt, and taking ownership of tasks. During the SNHU Travel project, participating in daily standups and offering feedback on features helped keep the team aligned and productive. Good teamwork ensures that the project stays on track and meets stakeholder expectations.
